### Analyzing the Relationship Between Egg Prices and Unemployment in the U.S. (1980–2024)  

This project explores the relationship between U.S. egg prices and unemployment rates from 1980 to 2024. The goal is to examine whether changes in unemployment are associated with changes in egg prices, and to analyze long-term economic trends using real public datasets. The analysis is part of SI 618 Project Part III and builds on earlier project phases.
